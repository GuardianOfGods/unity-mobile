# Roadmap
For all the newbies, having a clear roadmap will save you time and effort significantly. This is a simple design for you to easily visualize:

- First, let's start by **getting acquainted with a programming language** that is well-supported for game development in Unity, such as **C#**. You can find courses, lectures, and tutorials on websites like w3schools, youTube, even in books, or wherever you can find them.
  
- **Once you have a solid understanding of C#**, it's time to learn about **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Object-Oriented Programming is an essential component in game development. Mastering OOP will help you design and build a strong programming foundation.
  
- **Learn algorithm programming**. You can practice problem-solving and optimization skills on websites like LeetCode, Codeforces, etc. This is quite important because both system programming and gameplay mechanics in games heavily rely on these skills.
  
- On a fine day, while you're happily programming with ChatGPT, you accidentally delete your entire project. That could very well be your darkest day. Therefore, using **Git** is an indispensable tool if you want to ensure that your precious lines of code are safely stored.

- After you have a good foundational knowledge of programming and Git, you can transition to the phase of starting to learn **Unity**. Unity Engine is a massive game development software, so learning it without proper guidance can be confusing. Therefore, it's important to learn from reputable sources, such as Unity Learn, Brackeys, and others.
